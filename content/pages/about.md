Summary: About Ricardo  

My name is Ricardo Rosado and my professional summary used to be simple. I was a
veterinary virologist, end of story. Nowadays my profesional summary reads:


As for my personal background, I was born in Brazil, moved to Portugal before my
teens, and decided to keep on moving. After a few extra years travelling around
Europe I finally settled at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Lisbon,
Portugal, which led me to an Integrated Masters in Veterinary Science
specializing in veterinary virology and molecular diagnostics. Currently, I’m a
doctoral candidate at the
[Norwegian School of Veterinary Science](http://www.nvh.no) in Oslo, Norway,
where I’m looking at the presence and quantity of viruses in surface water and
wastewater for the purpose of risk assessment.

My professional interests include
["One Health"](http://www.onehealthinitiative.com/) and public health,
bioinformatics and metagenomics, disease surveillance and wildlife disease, as
well as research policy and higher education. These last interests recently led
me to reevaluate my career perspectives. A couple of months into my PhD, I
became a board member of my local PhD organization in the first place, and later
to Eurodoc, as delegate, president of the Association of doctoral organizations
in Norway, and workgroup coordinator. At the moment I’m Vice-president of the
Doktorgradkandidatenes interesseorganisasjon ved Veterinærmiljøene (DIOV) and
I’m doing my best to finish my PhD while planning a wedding.  In my younger
years I practiced karate, capoeira and aikido, and I learnt to swim before I
could walk, but as the years progressed I’ve moved on to more peaceful practices
like yoga and meditation. I play the classical guitar, dabble on the portuguese
guitar, and found my instrument of choice, the mandolin, after almost 30 years
of looking. I love animals of all kinds and plan on having a big enough house
for all of them, and I enjoy the wonderful norwegian habit of being outdoors.
